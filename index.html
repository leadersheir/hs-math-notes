        <h2>Chapter 5 Combinatorics</h2>

        <h4>Permutations</h4>

        The <em>number of permutations</em> is the number of ways in which \(n\) objects can be arranged taking \(r\) objects at a time, and is denoted by
        \[
          {}^nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
        \]

        From which follows
        \[
          {}^nP_n = n! \impliedby 0! \equiv 1
        \]

        The number of permutations of \(n\) objects, where \(k\) groups of similar items have \(a_k\) repetitions, is given by
        \[
          \frac{n!}{\prod_{i=1}^k a_i!}
        \]

        For example, if there are three groups with \(a_1\) items in the first group, \(a_2\) items in the second, and \(a_3\) items in the third, then the number of permutations of \(n\) items is given by
        \[
          \frac{n!}{a_1! \cdot a_2! \cdot a_3!}
        \]

        <div class="example">
          <em>Example</em><br>
          Let's consider the number of arrangements of the word "HIPPOPOTAMONSTROSESQUIPPEDALIOPHOBIA" with all 36 letters taken at once.
          In our word of interest, <em>h</em> is repeated 2 times; <em>i</em>, 4 times; <em>p</em>, 6 times; <em>o</em>, 6 times; <em>t</em>, 2 times; <em>a</em>, 3 times; <em>s</em>, 2 times; <em>e</em>, 2 times; and the rest (m, n, r, q, u, d, b) are not repeated. So the number of permutations (arrangements) of our word taking all letters at once is
          \[
            \frac{36!}{2! \cdot 4! \cdot 6! \cdot 6! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!}
          \]
          You can easily evaluate that using a calculator.

        <h4>Combinations</h4>
        <em style="font-weight: bold">def</em> Combination. Each of the groups or collections that can be made out of a given number of objects taking some or all of them at a time is called a <em>combination</em>.

        The number of combinations of \(n\) items taken \(r\) at a time is denoted by \({}^nC_r\). The combination of \(n\) items taken \(1\) at a time is a permutation; taken \(2\) at a time is another permutation; by extension, taken \(r\) at a time is the final permutation. The total number of permutations is obtained by multiplying the total number of combinations of \(n\) items taken \(r\) at a time multiplied by \(r!\). 
        \begin{align}
          {}^nC_r \times r! &= {}^nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \\
          \implies {}^nC_r &= \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
        \end{align}

        <h5>Complementarity of Combinations</h5>
        The <em>complementarity of combinations</em> implies the following
        \[
          {}^nC_r = {}^nC_{n-r}
        \]
        This relationship is easily derived from the definition of the number of combinations of \(n\) items taken \(r\) at a time.
        \[
          {}^nC_{n-r} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!(n-n+r)!} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!} = {}^nC_r \qquad \blacksquare
        \]

        The <em>complementarity of combinations</em> follows that
        \[
          {}^nC_x = {}^nC_y \quad \text{and} \quad x \neq y \implies x + y = n
        \]

        <h5>The Addition Rule of Combinations</h5>
        The <em>addition rule of combinations</em> is as follows
        \[
          {}^nC_r + {}^nC_{r-1} = {}^{n+1}C_r
        \]

        In general
        \[
          {}^{n+k}C_r = \sum_{i=0}^{k} \begin{pmatrix} k \\ i \end{pmatrix} {}^nC_{r-i}
        \]

        <div class="example">
          <em>Example</em>
          \begin{align}
            {}^{n+2}C_r &= {}^nC_r + 2{}^nC_{r-1} + {}^nC{r-2} \\
            {}^{n+3}C_r &= {}^nC_r + 3{}^nC_{r-1} + 3{}^nC_{r-2} + {}^nC_{r-3}
          \end{align}
        </div>

        <h5>Conditional Combination</h5>

        The number of combinations of \(n\) different things taken \(r\) at a time in which \(p \leq r\) particular things <em>always occur</em> is given by
        \[
          {}^{n-p}C_{r-p}
        \]

        The number of combinations of \(n\) different things taken \(r\) at a time in which \(p \leq r\) particular things <em>never occur</em> is given by
        \[
          {}^{n-p}C_r
        \]

        The number of combinations of \(n\) different things taken at least one at a time is given by
        \[
          2^n - 1
        \]

        The number of combinations of any numnber of things taken any number at a time (the total number of things must necessarily be greater than the number of things taken at once) when \(j\) groups of similar items have \(a_j\) repetitions and \(k\) items are unique (not repeated), is given by
        \[
          2^k \left( \prod_{i=1}^j (a_i + 1) \right) - 1
        \]
        \(k=0\) if there are no unique items.

        The number of combinations of any number of things taking at least 1 item from each of \(j\) groups of similar items with \(a_j\) repetitions is given by
        \[
          \prod_{i=1}^j \sum_{m=1}^{a_i} {}^{a_i}C_m = \prod_{i=1}^j (2^{a_i} -1) = (2^{a_1} - 1)(2^{a_2} - 1) \dots (2^{a_j} - 1)
        \]

        The number of ways in which \((p+q)\) things can be distributed among two specific groups \(A\) and \(B\) such that \(A\) contains \(p\) things and \(B\) contains \(q\) things is given by
        \[
          \frac{2!(p+q)!}{p!q!}
        \]

        The number of ways in which \((p+q)\) things can be distributed among two arbitrary groups such that one group contains \(p\) things and the other group contains \(q\) things is given by
        \[
          \frac{(p+q)!}{p!q!}
        \]

        The number of ways of distributing \(nq\) things among \(n\) specific groups is given by
        \[
          \frac{(nq)!}{n!(q!)^n}
        \]

        The number of ways of distributing \(nq\) things among \(n\) arbitrary groups is given by
        \[
          \frac{(nq)!}{(q!)^n}
        \]
